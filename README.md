What's working:

- shut down/sleep
- two monitors(configured using Hackintool, must manually assign DPs and HDMIs)
- Bluetooth(bought a third-party Bluetooth USB drive)
- FaceTime, Imessage*

What's not working(as smoothly):
- does take a while for hackintosh to detect second monitor. Try turning the second monitor on after logging in
